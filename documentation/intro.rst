Introduction to mermithid
--------------------------

Mermithid is a python package for Project 8 analyses.
Since `morpho`_ is a very generic package, mermithid is built to extend morpho, adding new functions and processors for Project 8 specific needs.
It also interfaces with external C++ libraries (`Cicada`_ and `Phylloxera`_) used in these new processors.

.. _Phylloxera: https://github.com/project8/phylloxera

The core functioning of mermithid is similar to morpho.
Mermithid can be used from morpho config files or inside a python script thanks to its python interface.
