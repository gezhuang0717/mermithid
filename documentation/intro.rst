Introduction to mermithid
--------------------------

Mermithid is a python package for Project 8 analyses.
Since morpho is a very generic package, mermithid is built to extend morpho, adding new functions and processors for Project 8 specific needs.
It also interfaces with external C++ libraries (Cicada and Phylloxera) used in these new processors.


The core functioning of mermithid is similar to morpho.
Mermithid can be used from morpho config files or inside a python script thanks to its python interface.
